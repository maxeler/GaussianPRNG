=============================
Gaussian PRNG App
=============================

This Application enables you to generate Gaussian distributed random numbers using Maxeler DFEs


Introduction
------------

This APP showcases how Gaussian PRNGs can be implemented using MaxJ and using the MaxPower library provided by Maxeler.


Features
--------

* Mean and Variance of the Gaussian distributed random numbers can be chosen freely
* Underlying PRNG is the MersenneTwister of the MaxPower library
* Hardware resources can be shared by two PRNGs leading to greatly reduced hardware costs
